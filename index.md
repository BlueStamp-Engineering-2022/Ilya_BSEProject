# LED Electrical clock
This project consists of a Lightboard attatched to an Ardiuno coded to display the time on the LED board. They are placed inside of a wooden box for stability and safekeeping. One side of the box is clear so that anyone can read the time without having to open the box.

# Final Milestone
I finished the project and I learned a lot about Matricies and about coding on an Arduino. The project was very fun to make and I ended up finishing it on time. The project was a clock with a military time format.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was coding the Arduino to project two numbers on the LED board and I ended up actually getting the time to work. I struggled a lot with coding the Matrix, but I eventually figured it out and now have a working clock.

# Starter project
  

My starter project was setting up and creating a BugEye project. The transmitters were added to ensure that the device was working and sensing if it is in the dark or the light. It took me about one class (four hours) to complete it. The process consisted of mainly soldering. I had to solder the transmitters, the LED's, the sensor, and the battery all on to the base of the bug.
